                <p>Coming into this bootcamp, I was nervous. Taking on a full set of skills that I really had no experience
                in (other than a few courses in high school) was worrisome. Looking back now, I'm so proud of myself for
                how far
                I've come! I've fully immersed myself in the many different technologies, frameworks, and database
                management systems that the software community has to offer. Now, my skills include building full-stack
                web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, incorporating different API's, using Node,
                Express, MySQL, Handlebars,
                Sequelize, React, and so much more. Learning all of these different technologies at such a fast pace
                within the last six months has me ready to continue learning and sharpen my skills even more!</p>
                <p>Some other skills I accquire is my love to work with other people. I find myself to be one of the best
                when it comes to communcation, patience, and solving problems within a team. Understanding other people, their
                belief systems, their mental and personal characteristics is something I pride myself in. I'm easily
                adaptable to all kinds of
                situations and find myself to be completely solution focused. I manage my time very well and will always
                surround myself with a positive work environment.</p>
                <p>My desired role within a company is to write and style
                the front-end components that
                meet the requirements of our mocks and fulfill our user stories. I would love the chance to meet you and
                your hiring
                team to get to know each other better and the qualities I can add to your company.</p>
